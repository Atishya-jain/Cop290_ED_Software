Try to avoid static keyword as much as possible
Don't use data members of same class from static functions as they will require datamembers to be static too

3D to 2D point convention ->
representation -> a^b^c^d and so on
if this is in X-Y plave the Z coordinate of a > b > c > d

If there is an edge between a -> b the there is also edge between b -> a
i.e it will be present in the graph

1st member of vector list given by map graph is the point itself

Input angle in degrees
